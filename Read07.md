# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

- ## TABLES IN HTML:

*HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.*


**Define an HTML Table**

*The <**table**> tag defines an HTML table.*

*Each table row is defined with a <**tr**> tag. Each table header is defined with a <**th**> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <**td**> tag.*

*By default, the text in <**th**> elements are bold and centered.*

*By default, the text in <**td**> elements are regular and left-aligned.*


*To add a border to a table, use the CSS border property:*

  **border: 1px solid black;**

*Cell padding specifies the space between the cell content and its borders.*

*If you do not specify a padding, the table cells will be displayed without padding.*

*To set the padding, use the CSS padding property:*

## In the summury:

- Use the HTML <**table**> element to define a table
- Use the HTML <**tr**> element to define a table row
- Use the HTML <**td**> element to define a table data
- Use the HTML <**th**> element to define a table heading
- Use the HTML <**caption**> element to define a table caption
- Use the CSS border property to define a border
- Use the CSS border-collapse property to collapse cell borders
- Use the CSS padding property to add padding to cells
- Use the CSS text-align property to align cell text
- Use the CSS border-spacing property to set the spacing between cells
- Use the colspan attribute to make a cell span many columns
- Use the rowspan attribute to make a cell span many rows
- Use the id attribute to uniquely define one table.



- ## FUNCTION IN JS:

![IMG](https://i.redd.it/1x4ho2qngv421.jpg)

*A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.*

*A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).*



**Function Invocation**
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)


### Why Functions?
*You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.*

*You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.*


- ## OBJECTS IN JS:

*In real life, a car is an object.*

*A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stoP*

*All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.*

*All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.*

**Object Methods**

Objects can also have methods.

Methods are **actions** that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as **function definitions**.



**The this Keyword**

In a function definition, **this** refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, **this** is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

In other words, **this.firstName** means the **firstName** property of **this object.**
