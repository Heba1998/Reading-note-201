*There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.*

*There are several things to consider when selecting and
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them
right will make it look more attractive and professional.*



- The <**img**> element is used to add images to a
web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

- Use the HTML <**img**> element to define an image
- Use the HTML **src** attribute to define the URL of the image
- Use the HTML **alt** attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
- Use the HTML **width** and **height** attributes or the CSS **width** and **height** properties to define the size of the image
- Use the CSS **float** property to let the image float to the left or to the right



* ## **COLOR**

*The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element.* **You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:**

- rgb values
     - These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
- hex codes
     - These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
- color names
    - There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan



**SUMMARY**
- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

-  There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

-  Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

-  It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

-  CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

-  CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


* ## **TEXT**

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
-  There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
-  If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
-  You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
-  You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
