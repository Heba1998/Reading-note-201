# Debugging in JavaScript

*Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.*

*Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.*

*Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.*

*Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.*


- ## **The console.log() Method**
*If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window*

- ## **Setting Breakpoints**
*In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.*

*At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.*

*After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).*

- ## **The debugger Keyword**

*The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.*

*This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.*


- **Major Browsers' Debugging Tools**
   - Firefox
   - Chrome
   - Edge
   - Opera
   - Safari

   **SUMMURY**
- If you understand execution contexts (which have two
stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.
- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
- The console helps narrow down the area in which the
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
