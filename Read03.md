**What is the list in html?**

*HTML lists are used to present list of information in well formed and semantic way.*

HTML have three different types to defined a list: 
1. **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

2. **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

3.  **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

*The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.*


**You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:**

-  Control the dimensions of your boxes
-  Create borders around boxes
-  Set margins and padding for boxes
-  Show and hide boxes

- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.


* ## **SWITCH STATEMENTS IN JS**

*The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case , as well as statements in case s that follow the matching case .*

*switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).*
