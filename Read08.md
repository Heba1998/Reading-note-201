**CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:**

 *normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the positionproperty in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property. To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.*


 HTML5 Semantic Elements

* **article** - Defines an independent, self-contained content
* **aside** - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
* **footer** - Defines a footer for a document or a section

* **summary** - Defines a heading for the **details** element.


**we can Summarize oll of thing in some points:**

- **div** elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
-  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
-  The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
-  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
-  CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
-  You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
