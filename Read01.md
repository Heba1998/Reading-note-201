*HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.*

**So what is HTML?**
*HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.*

**The main parts of our element are as follows:**

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

**HTML Extra Markup:**

**Markup** *is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.*
**A markup** *tag is a directive that contains snippet of code with a relative reference to an object in your store such as a variable, URL, image, or block. Markup tags can be used anywhere the editor is available and incorporated into the HTML of email and newsletter templates, as well as other types of content.*


**HTML Layout Elements**

HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
* HTML5 Semantic Elements	:
  * **<header>** - Defines a header for a document or a section
  * **<nav>** - Defines a set of navigation links
  * **<section>** - Defines a section in a document
  * **<article>** - Defines an independent, self-contained content
  * **<footer>** - Defines a footer for a document or a section

What is a Script and how do I create one ?
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
