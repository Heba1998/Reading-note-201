*The Fade in is great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action. (Make sure you set the class of your div to “fade” to see this working.)*


 *With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. general layout techniques like size, position, and change elements.* **All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.**


*CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element.*

* 2D and 3D Transforms
    * 2D, 3D  Rotate
    * 2D, 3D  Scale
    * 2D, 3D  Translate
    * 2D, 3D  Skew

*With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.*

*Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.*


- Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.
