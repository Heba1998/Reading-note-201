*Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.*

**By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:**

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red

**we can Summarize oll of thing in some points:**

- Use the **a**  element to define a link
- Use the **href** attribute to define the link address
- Use the **target** attribute to define where to open the linked document
- Use the **img** element (inside **a**) to use an image as a link
- Use the **mailto:** scheme inside the **href** attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
-  You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
-  You can use the **id** attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
* **header** - Defines a header for a document or a section
* **nav** - Defines a set of navigation links
* **section** - Defines a section in a document
* **article** - Defines an independent, self-contained * content
* **aside** - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
* **footer** - Defines a footer for a document or a section
* **details** - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
* **summary** - Defines a heading for the **details** element



**we can Summarize oll of thing in some points:**

- **div** elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
-  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
-  The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
-  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
-  CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
-  You can include multiple CSS files in one page.


* ## **Functions in JavaScript:**

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}


**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).*
