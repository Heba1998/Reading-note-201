*An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.*

*Forms contain special elements called controls like inputbox, checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons, etc. Users generally complete a form by modifying its controls e.g. entering text, selecting items, etc. and submitting this form to a web server for further processing.*

**The following section describes different types of controls that you can use in your form.**

* **Input Element**
*The most frequently used input types are:*

    - **Text Fields**
 *are one line areas that allow the user to input text*
    - **Password Field**
*Password fields are similar to text fields. The only difference is; characters in a password field are masked, i.e. they are shown as asterisks or dots.*


- **Radio Buttons**
*Radio buttons are used to let the user select exactly one option from a pre-defined set of options.*

 - **Checkboxes**
*Checkboxes allows the user to select one or more option from a pre-defined set of options.*

- **File Select box**
*The file fields allow a user to browse for a local file and send it as an attachment with the form data.*

*HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.*

*When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.*


**What is an Event ?**
*JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.*

*When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.*

*Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.*
