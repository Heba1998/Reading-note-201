**When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.** 

* There are 2 kind of markup:
   * Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
   * Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on


* **Structural markup:**   
   * Headings
      * HTML has six "levels" of headings:
     **h1** is used for main headings
     **h2** is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the **h3** element is used, and so on...

    * Paragraph:
      *  To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening **p** tag and closing **/p** tag.

    * Bold & Italic
       * **b** bold & **i** italic

    *  Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
       * **br** & **hr**



* **Semantic markup:**
   * Strong & Emphasis
   * Quotations
   * Abbreviations & Acronyms

   *AND SO ON..*

   **CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.**

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
