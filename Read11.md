*You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.*


*By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.*


*Use the HTML <**img**> element to define an image*

*Use the HTML **src** attribute to define the URL of the image*

*Use the HTML **alt** attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed*

*Use the HTML **width** and **height** attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image*

*Use the CSS **float** property to let the image float to the left or to the right*



**Summary**


- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
- Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.
